% CONVRSION FROM LONG TO SHORT FORMAT AND VICE VERSA
% "Long" format data has columns for different factors in the leftmost columns,
% and a single rightmost column containing the data.
% "Short" format data can have some or no factor columns, and has a number of rightmost columns
% containing data that are combinations of factors. 

% To convert between 2 different "Short" formats, the script needs to be run twice:
% 1. Short to Long
% 2. Long to new Short
