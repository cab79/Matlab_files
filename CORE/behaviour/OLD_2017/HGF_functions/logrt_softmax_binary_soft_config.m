% Contains the configuration for the linear log-reaction time response model according to as

% The Gaussian noise observation model assumes that responses have a Gaussian distribution around
% the inferred mean of the relevant state. The only parameter of the model is the noise variance
% (NOT standard deviation) zeta.
